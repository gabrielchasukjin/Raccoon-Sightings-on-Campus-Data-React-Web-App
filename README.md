# Campus Raccoon Sightings App

With a plethora of cute raccoons across UC San Diego campus, I developed a full-stack app to track the sightings of these mischievous creatures across campus. 

The purpose of this project is to learn and practice concepts related to:
• API Calls
• Spatial Data
• Cloud Storage 

More specifially, I applied the following:  
• Leveraged React and Firebase Cloud to develop full-stack application for tracking raccoon sightings on UC San Diego campus
• Integrated Google Maps API to display campus location and Firebase Cloud to sync realtime data across all client apps
