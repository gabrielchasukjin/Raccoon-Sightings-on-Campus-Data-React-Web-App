Site Link: https://gabrielchasukjin.github.io/Raccoon-Sightings-on-Campus-Data-React-Web-App/

**With a plethora of cute raccoons across UC San Diego campus, I developed a full-stack app to track the sightings of these mischievous creatures across campus.** 

### The purpose of this project is to learn and practice concepts related to:
> - React.js Hooks (State/Effect)
> - Google Maps API 
> - Firebase Cloud 
> 
#### More specifially, I applied the following:  
> - Leveraged React and Firebase Cloud to develop full-stack application for tracking raccoon sightings on UC San Diego campus
> - Integrated Google Maps API to display campus location and Firebase Cloud to sync realtime data across all client apps
